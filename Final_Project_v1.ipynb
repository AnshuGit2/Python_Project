    "## Project Overview\n",
    "The objective of this project is to afford you the opportunity to demonstrate the\n",
    "skills acquired over the course of the semester.  Specifically, you will be constructing\n",
    "an analytics-ready dataset using data from several disparate, but related data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your dataset is to be a pandas dataframe suitable for answering the proof-of-concept\n",
    "questions located at the end of this document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Scenario\n",
    "You are the proprietor of a small tour company.  You are interested in launching a new app\n",
    "that will allow users to undertake self-guided tours of noteworthy authors. To launch your app\n",
    "you need to assemble the authors' location information along with some other facts that you\n",
    "believe will be of interest to your customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sources\n",
    "You will be collecting and assembling data from several different sources and formats.\n",
    "1. Source 1 - web scraping\n",
    "1. Source 2 - delimitted file\n",
    "1. Source 3 - direct download XML file\n",
    "1. Source 4 - Zip Code API\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Teams\n",
    "Working on a team is not a requirement and you may complete the project on your own.\n",
    "Thus, project team(s) may be composed of 1 or **at most** 2 students. If you are working\n",
    "with another student please, ensure both of your names are clearly visible in your final solution JNB.\n"

    " <br/><br/> Another, far better, approach involves a careful reading the documentation paying special attention to the *sort*\n",
